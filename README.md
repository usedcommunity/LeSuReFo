# LeSuReFo
legal sustainability requirements forecast (LeSuReFo) is a project for a webapp that prepares and makes available sustainability requirements from laws, 
certificates, standards, norms, sustainability models and scientific sources for people and companies from different domains as a metamodel. 
In addition to the analysis and evaluation of current and planned laws, the transfer of knowledge from research to practice is also supported via the community.
